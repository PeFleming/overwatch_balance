### Hi there 👋

This project aims to look at play statistics retrieved from [overwatchleague.com](https://overwatchleague.com/en-us/statslab). We will then attempt to use [this](https://www.esportstales.com/overwatch/list-all-hero-updates-and-balance-changes) list of hero stat adjusments to predict/recommend future hero updates.
